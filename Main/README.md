Q. What is middleware?
Ans. Middleware is like a helper that sits in the middle of your backend app and helps process requests before they reach your main logic.

--> Middleware accept three parameters request, response and next.
--> In express, post() method doesn't provide the info. to the end user (i.e. in url), whereas get() method provide.

-> Built-in middleware

--> In database, when you've to create or retrieve the data from the database, you need 'userModel'.

--> find() function returns all the users details(i.e. objects), whereas findOne() returns only one object either there are same many users(more than one).
